# Description
There are two parts to this project. First, I took the data, processed it and developed a regression model to predict user's data. Lastly, I designed a web application using streamlit and push my github folders to streamlit hosting cloud.

Some of the errors I encountered and fixes:
1. streamlit : The term 'streamlit' is not recognized as the name 
of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check   
the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify      
that the path is correct and try again.
